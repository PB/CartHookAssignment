# CartHookAssignment

## D

### Task
Write a function that sorts 10000 powers (a^b) where a and b are random numbers between 100 and 10000? Estimate how long it would take on your machine?

### Solution
To run: `go run main.go` or `./bin/sorter2`


### Test
`go test`

### How long it took:
```
generateSlice took 1.225470693s
selectionSort took 429.237016ms
```
Generating this array took more than soring it.
